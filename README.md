🌳 Learning Decision Trees Through Hands-On Practice

Recently, I worked on building a Decision Tree model to analyze a dataset and make meaningful predictions. This project helped me understand not just how models work, but why they make certain decisions.

✨ What I focused on:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned numerical and categorical data, handled missing values, and applied scaling where needed

EDA: Explored distributions, correlations, and patterns to truly understand the data

Model Building: Trained a Decision Tree classifier and fine-tuned hyperparameters

Evaluation: Assessed performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score

Insights: Identified key features influencing predictions and visualized the decision paths for better interpretability

What I love about Decision Trees is how intuitive they are—they don’t just predict outcomes, they clearly show how decisions are made.

💡 Key takeaway: Following a structured ML workflow—EDA → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation—makes results clearer, more reliable, and easier to explain.
